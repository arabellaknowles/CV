## Arabella Knowles

I am a highly motivated and ambitious person with strong analytical, problem solving and social skills. Keen to begin my career in full stack web development. I currently specialise in Ruby, however, I can quickly adapt and pick up another language.

## Experience

**SmartTMS** (Jun-Jul'19)  
_Summer Internship_

- Handling customer relations, following up on customer satisfaction and navigating through complaints avoiding conflicts. These skills are applicable to all fields I think it will be invaluable during potential disagreements encountered in paired programming and client interactions.
- Seeing technology alter neuronal pathways and aiding mental health disorders really motivated me to learn coding.

**Portabar** (Jun-Aug'16/'17/'18)  
_Summer Internship_

- Dealing with clients, fielding sales enquiries and managing orders. 

**Forensic Access** (Jul-Aug'15)  
_Summer Internship_

- Archiving files from old cases has made me maticulous in my typing up of information. No mistakes can be made. This has been a very helpful habit to have aquired for coding.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Throughout my life I have always loved problem solving, whether it was doing maths at school or suduko puzzles. I thrive off challenges, so when something is wrong, I enjoy trying to uncover the error and correct it. In my degree I would be presented with a list of symptoms and have to work out which neurone or mechanism was dysfunctioning and the cause behind it. In a similar way to debugging a code; follow the error messages and identifying the mistake. It is such a good feeling when you have spent time on a problem finally solving the issue and passing the tests.

#### Analytical

A major part of my degree was statistical analysis. I used IBM SPSS statistics to manipulate and analyse large datasets, looking for trends and abnormalities within the results. This required focus and attention to detail. Different statistical tests can have different outputs and different assumptions. It is about taking into account all the information provided to generate a well informed assessment. I received 80% in my final year exam. 

#### Team Work and Leadership

I have performed in musicals, played many team sports and been a member of a Jazz Band, in these activities collaboration with others achieves the best outcome for the whole project and also develops you as a person. I find working with peers is one of the best ways to learn new techniques and styles you have not encountered before. This is essential for software development. Furthermore, I was deputy head girl of Cheltenham College, in this role I coordinated events such as our twelve-hour charity run which earnt approximately £10,000 for Meningitus Now. Overseeing and directing twenty-four of my peers has made me more confident and not afraid of taking control. This is a key skill when working in a team.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Sept'20-Dec'20)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (Sept'17-June'20)
**Bachelor of Science - BS, Neuroscience, 1st class honours**

- Computational Neuroscience - This unit detailed how computational networks are based off and mirror neuronal signalling. It is what originally inspired me to begin coding. There is a huge overlap between neuronal firing and running a program, which gives me a unique perspective when analysing code. 
- My dissertation investigated the role of Transferrin receptor 2 in mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. I received the 3rd highest mark in my year.
- Statistics - I went into the syntax editor in SPSS to change the output of specific tables and graphs.
- Neurodegenative Diseases
- The Heart in Health and Disease
- Synaptic Cell Biology

These units are all based on networks; the processes that dysfunction resulting in neurodegeneration, the looping mechanisms maintaining the heart beat and the transmission of messages across a synapse. I believe that studying these topics has made me an excellent canditate for software development. No synapse, neurodegenerative or heart disease is the same, even though the processes may be similar you have to know the different proteins, cells and mechanisms involved. Being able take in a large volume of information and separate minor details makes me good at learning new languages in short spaces of time. 

#### Cheltenham College (Sept'12-June'16)

**A Levels** 
- Biology: A*
