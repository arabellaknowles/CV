## Arabella Knowles

I am a highly motivated and ambitious person with strong analytical, problem solving and social skills. Keen to begin my career in full stack web development. I currently specialise in Ruby, however, I can quickly adapt and pick up another language.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Problem Solving

Throughout my life I have always loved problem solving, whether it was doing maths at school or suduko puzzles. I thrive off challenges, so when something is wrong, I enjoy trying to uncover the error and correct it. In my degree I would be presented with a list of symptoms and have to work out which neurone or mechanism was dysfunctioning and the cause behind it. In a similar way to debugging a code; follow the error messages and identifying the mistake. It is such a good feeling when you have spent time on a problem finally solving the issue and passing the tests.

#### Analytical

A major part of my degree was statistical analysis. I used IBM SPSS statistics to manipulate and analyse large datasets, looking for trends and abnormalities within the results. This required focus and attention to detail. Different statistical tests can have different outputs and different assumptions. It is about taking into account all the information provided to generate a well informed assessment. I received 80% in my final year exam. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Sept'20-Dec'20)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (Sept'17-June'20)
**Bachelor of Science - BS, Neuroscience, 1st class honours**

- Computational Neuroscience - This unit detailed how computational networks are based off and mirror neuronal signalling. It is what originally inspired me to begin coding. There is a huge overlap between neuronal firing and running a program, which gives me a unique perspective when analysing code. 
- My dissertation investigated the role of Transferrin receptor 2 in mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. I received the 3rd highest mark in my year.
- Statistics - I went into the syntax editor in SPSS to change the output of specific tables and graphs.
- Neurodegenative Diseases
- The Heart in Health and Disease
- Synaptic Cell Biology

These units are all based on networks; the processes that dysfunction resulting in neurodegeneration, the looping mechanisms maintaining the heart beat and the transmission of messages across a synapse. I believe that studying these topics has made me an excellent canditate for software development. No synapse, neurodegenerative or heart disease is the same, even though the processes may be similar you have to know the different proteins, cells and mechanisms involved. Being able take in a large volume of information and separate minor details makes me good at learning new languages in short spaces of time. 

#### Cheltenham College (Sept'12-June'16)

**A Levels** 
- Biology: A*
- Maths: A*
- Chemistry: A

**GSCEs**
- 7A*'s, 3A's

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
