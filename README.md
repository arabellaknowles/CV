I am a highly motivated and ambitious person with strong analytical, problem solving and software development skills. Keen to begin my career in full-stack web development. I currently specialise in Ruby and JavaScript, however, I can quickly adapt and pick up another language.

## Experience

**SmartTMS** (Jun-Jul'19)  
_Summer Internship_

- Supported the accounts team in managing customer relations and gathering customer feedback. 
- Navigating through complaints, whilst avoiding conflicts, has proved invaluable when leading software development projects.

**Portabar** (Jun-Aug'16/'17/'18)  
_Data Analyst Internship_

- Creating new innovative ways to attract new clients based on social media statistics and website activity. This has boosted my understanding of client needs when designing websites.

**Forensic Access** (Jul-Aug'15)  
_Summer Internship_

- Observed and assisted the handling and analysis of forensic cases. Dealing with sensitive data has made me meticulous, which has been vital when coding.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- When I studied Neuroscience at the University of Bristol, I would be presented with a list of symptoms and have to uncover which neurone or mechanism was dysfunctioning and the cause behind it. This process is very similar to debugging a code; follow the error messages and identify the mistake.

#### Analytical

- A major part of my degree was statistical analysis. I used IBM SPSS statistics to manipulate and analyse large datasets, looking for trends and abnormalities within the results. This required extreme focus and attention to detail. I received 80% in my final year statistics exam. 

#### Team Work and Leadership

- I have performed in musicals, played many team sports and been a member of a jazz band. In these activities collaboration with others achieves the best outcome for the whole project and also develops you as a person. I find working with peers is one of the best ways to learn new techniques, which is essential for software development.
