I am an energetic, ambitious junior software engineer with strong problem solving, analytical and mathematical skills. My interest in software development sparked during my Neuroscience degree when manipulating the output of an SPSS statistical test by using the syntax editor. It inspired me to do the Coding for Girls Python course, which led me to join Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp. In just four months I have gone from creating basic Ruby methods to building webapps using multiple different languages, libraries and frameworks. Majority created with tests, relational databases and styling. I currently specialise in Ruby and Javascript and I can quickly and effectively pick-up new technologies. I thrive off an information heavy, high intensity working environment and cannot wait to begin my career in software development.

## Work Experience

**SmartTMS** (Jun-Jul'19)  
_Summer Internship_

- Enhanced research and analysis skills by writing a research paper on how their Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation technology alters neurological pathways.
- Managed customer relations, gathered feedback and navigated through complaints. These communication skills have proved invaluable when leading software development team projects.

**Portabar** (Jun-Aug'16/'17/'18)  
_Data Analyst Internship_

- Increased client interactions by altering website and social media presentation, based on social media statistics and website analytics. This has boosted my understanding of client needs when designing websites.

**Forensic Access** (Jul-Aug'15)  
_Summer Internship_

- Observed and assisted the handling and analysis of forensic cases. Dealing with sensitive data has made me meticulous, which has been vital when coding.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- When I studied Neuroscience, I would be presented with a list of symptoms or data and have to uncover which neurone or mechanism was dysfunctioning and the cause behind it. From this I have developed a methodological approach to breaking down and solving large problems. This skill has been instrumental when tackling large client requirements in software development projects and in debugging a code.

#### Analytical

- A major part of my degree was statistical analysis. I used IBM SPSS statistics to manipulate and analyse large datasets, looking for trends and abnormalities within the results. This required extreme focus and attention to detail. I received 80% in my final year statistics exam. 

#### Team Work

- I have performed in musicals, played many team sports and been a member of a jazz band. In these activities collaboration with others achieves the best outcome for the whole project and also develops you as a person. I find working with peers is one of the best ways to learn new techniques, which is essential for software development.

## Interests
-	Music and acting: I play the piano and sing. I have performed in musicals and in jazz bands.
-	Sports: I play hockey, netball and I am an avid runner.
