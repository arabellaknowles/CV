<h1 align=center> Arabella Knowles </h1>

I am a highly ambitious, energetic junior software developer with strong problem solving, analytical and mathematical skills. I am a 2020 graduate from the University of Bristol, with a 1st class honours in Neuroscience (BSc).  I currently specialise in Ruby and JavaScript and can quickly and efficiently learn new technologies.

## Work Experience

**SmartTMS** (Jun-Jul'19)  
_Summer Internship_

- Supported the accounts team in managing customer relations and gathering customer feedback. 
- Navigating through complaints, whilst avoiding conflicts, has proved invaluable when leading software development projects.

**Portabar** (Jun-Aug'16/'17/'18)  
_Data Analyst Internship_

- Creating new innovative ways to attract new clients based on social media statistics and website activity. This has boosted my understanding of client needs when designing websites.

**Forensic Access** (Jul-Aug'15)  
_Summer Internship_

- Observed and assisted the handling and analysis of forensic cases. Dealing with sensitive data has made me meticulous, which has been vital when coding. 

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- When I studied Neuroscience at the University of Bristol, I would be presented with a list of symptoms and have to uncover which neurone or mechanism was dysfunctioning and the cause behind it. This skill is transferable to coding as the process is very similar to debugging a code; follow the error messages and identify the mistake.

#### Analytical

- A major part of my degree was statistical analysis. I used IBM SPSS statistics to manipulate and analyse large datasets, looking for trends and abnormalities within the results. This required extreme focus and attention to detail. I received 80% in my final year statistics exam. 

#### Team Work and Leadership

- I have performed in musicals, played many team sports and been a member of a jazz band. In these activities collaboration with others achieves the best outcome for the whole project and also develops you as a person. I find working with peers is one of the best ways to learn new techniques, which is essential for software development.
